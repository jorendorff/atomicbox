//! Safe atomic boxes.
//!
//! The standard library provides atomic booleans, integers, and pointers.
//! `AtomicPtr` is safe for loading, storing, and so forth; but pointers are
//! unsafe to use.
//!
//! It turns out that a safe atomic `Box` type is possible. Unfortunately, the
//! only operation it supports is `swap`. Still, this is sufficient for some
//! lock-free data structures, so here it is!
